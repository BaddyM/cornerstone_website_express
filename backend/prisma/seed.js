                title:"Headteacher", message:"Dear Readers. I greet your in the name of  the all mighty God and would like to welcome you to our first events schools publication. Kindly Enjoy!! Years back on my graduation for my bachelors degree in education at Makerere University, the then chancellor professor Mondo George Kagonyera in his speech made a profound statement, 'Our universities and higher institions of learning produce more graduates then the jobs available everyyear, so as you go out my dear graduates ensure that you be creative and innovative, if you so desire to have an easy life” This statement still rings sbell in my head upto date. Todays worls needs people that are relevant and have something distinct to give. However there are very few people that are of a sort. Many people want to be like others which is very dangerous as it leaves as potential retarded.one has to be unique and with thus,you will develop a winning concept.People love seeing new things that is called growth and development. For one to have a winning concept,you need both science and art, art because you need the skills and use of imagination to express ideas and science because you need the right apparatus and formula. I has always wondered whether the high level of unemployment and moral decay are a reflection of our curriculum. The old curriculm which we have used since time memorial. This curriculum has caused us more problems that the level of unemployment and moral degeneration is blamed for it. I srongy agru because atleast the blamed curriculum at one time produced reliable professional since it was a combination with the home curriculum which has now been scrapped off. The home syllabus of values and virtues.Our homes are the first schools were we are nurtured however, they have become more of hotels for iur children and and bed and breakfast for we the parents. Why do parents today think that developing moderninty means keeping their children away from training ?? Homes are now being managed by home helps/ Managers who are the parents pay a substastial sum to actually take care of themselves, Their future families and homes at theexpense of their children. Now if the children do not value and love work at a tender age of, how do they expect them to translate the skills they learm into employmet opportunities?? Educatuon should not be limited to acquiring knowledge and skills but also the ability to translate these into employment opportunites. Yhe aquired skills should be enjoyed with impression. CBC – Competent Based Curriculum known as the new curricum which to me isn’t because it’s the very one we use way back before the whites brought theirs. What killed our curriculum. The excessive examination. People tended to passing exams them imparting skills knowledge, virtues, values, the slogan and competences. “ We shall pass exams by all means” Students then resulted to studying with purpose of passing exams not learning any skills this explains why we have graduates without love for work, country and neigbours etc. CBC is taking us back to the basis of acquiring skills  without crumming to pass exams. This has to be taken care of carefully to avoid going back to our usual cry. Many learned less skilled. He days may be gone but values and virtues are not tme bond. The values  of honesty,respect, Hardwork, humanity and trust coupled with the virtues of hope, faith. Patience and love has been with us since and are still relevant to sowety. Such were the values and virtues learned in the indigeonous curriculum and were only enhanced by the formal education we got in schools. Threfore parents, arise and take up our GOD given responsibilies by : Showing our valuable time with our children and listen to their concerns. Lets not be absentee parents who are busy making money and wealth which cant help much. Helping our children to face the true realities of life. Teaching our children the values and virtues of society despoiling our children to enable them become responsible adults- useful to society. Share with them our visions and help them to develop their own visions . andhowto getto them. Asparents, we should know that the future we are dying for should be prepared now lets teach our children values of hard work and the benefits that come along. Lets teach them that when you talk about childrens rights,they shoud also maintain their responsibilities as children. Best Wishes. 'Education the rock foundation'",

                title:"Deputy Headteacher",message:"I greet you in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ. This year has been a milestone. I salute you all for dragging your feet to the end of this amazing year. The discilpne of the students has been bearable this year as well as that of the students. If your student as an indisciple case know it that you have contributed to their behaviour because as you know “charity begins at home”. Well, some students struggle to make their discipline better, others are making step backs. However, we are here to guide you with whatever step you decide to make. Dear cornerstone, I don’t come to brag about my achievemets and accomplishments, I come to speak of communication. The rightful way of sending a message to another person. Parents and the school fall victim of poor communication because of fear of being misunderstood. Unfortunately the more you wait, the bigger the miscommunication the more you wait the bigger miscommunication gap. The more you are misunderstood. Silence is a langauge, noise and speech is a language. Any that you choose decide who you truly are, if you try to atleast express your self do your best to make sure the person your communicating to is getting the desired message and the intented interpretation is received.Communicate to the students, to the teachers, to parents to the school. This creates a connection and bond that could hold the key to perfect education for the rest of the levels and classes. I urge all parents and students to find effective communication important and put it in action. I pity a parent who has poor communication with his/her child for they know nothing about who this person is. Take time and speak to your children for in them we find counsellors, teachers, judges and innovators. Don’t be a parent who is surprised by the behavior of their child. We should always be telling you of what you already know. I request that you honor my concern for communication. I pray the good Lord guides us all to speak to each other with kindness for it creates a good environment for our students and setting a good example for the future generation. In conclusion, I would like to thank the almighty God for our achievements this year as presented in this magazine. Enjoy dear readers.",
